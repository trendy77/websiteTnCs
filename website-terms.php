<h3>Article 4. Terms of use of the Service</h3>
    It is up to the User to decide what information will be saved and/or exchanged using the Service. OrganiseMyBiz has no knowledge of that information. As such, the User bears responsibility for ensuring that that information is lawful and does not infringe upon any third-party rights. OrganiseMyBiz cannot accept any liability for the information saved and/or exchanged using the Service. The User hereby indemnifies OrganiseMyBiz against any claims from third parties that are based on the position that the information saved and/or exchanged by the User using the Service is unlawful.

OrganiseMyBiz reserves the right to remove or block the User's information in such an event, at OrganiseMyBiz's discretion. In no instance can OrganiseMyBiz be held liable for the damages resulting from such measures.
    The User agrees not to hinder other Users or Internet users or to damage the servers. The User may not start up any processes or programs, either on the server on which the Service runs or otherwise, of which the User is aware, or may reasonably expect, that they will hinder or cause damage to other Users or Internet users. OrganiseMyBiz will inform the User of any measures taken as a result.
    The User hereby indemnifies OrganiseMyBiz against all legal claims relating to the data, information, websites etc. stored by the User.
    In addition to any applicable statutory obligations, any damage caused by lack of expertise or failure to act in accordance with the provisions set out above will be for the User's expense.

<h3>Article 5. Intellectual property rights</h3>
    The title to all intellectual property rights to all software made available and to all preparatory material belonging to such software remains exclusively to OrganiseMyBiz or its licensors. The User only acquires a non-exclusive and non-transferable right of use, as well as any rights explicitly granted pursuant to these Terms and Conditions or otherwise.

<h3>Article 6. Liability</h3>
    OrganiseMyBiz cannot in any instant be held liable for indirect damages incurred by the User or third parties, including consequential damage, loss of turnover and profit, loss of data and intangible damage.
    OrganiseMyBiz's liability toward the User, on whatever grounds, is limited to the fees paid to OrganiseMyBiz by the User in the current calendar year (exclusive of VAT) per event (for which purpose a series of related events is deemed to constitute a single event).
    The User hereby indemnifies OrganiseMyBiz against all third-party claims, on whatever grounds, for compensation for damages, costs or interest relating to this Agreement and/or the Services.
    The previous items of this Article 6 do not apply if and insofar as the damages in question were caused by intent or wilful recklessness on the part of OrganiseMyBiz.

<h3>Article 7. Force Majeure</h3>
    In the event of force majeure, which is understood to include at least internal civil unrest, mobilisation, war, traffic obstructions, strikes, lockouts, interruption of operations, stagnation of supplies, fire, flooding and restrictions on imports and exports, and in the event that OrganiseMyBiz is rendered incapable of providing the Services by its own suppliers, regardless of the reasons for such, as a result of which OrganiseMyBiz cannot within reason be required to fulfil the Agreement, the implementation of the Agreement will be suspended, or else the Agreement will be terminated if the condition of force majeure lasts longer than four weeks. None of the situations outlined above will result in any liability to pay damages.

<h3>Article 8. Amendment of the Terms and Conditions</h3>
    OrganiseMyBiz reserves the right to amend or expand these Terms and Conditions.
    Amendments will also apply to Agreements concluded previously, with due observance of a period of 30 days after the amendments are announced on the Website or by electronic notification. Minor amendments may be implemented at any time.
    If the User does not wish to accept an amendment to these Terms and Conditions, he or she may, until the date on which the new Terms and Conditions enter into force, dissolve the Agreement with effect from that date or with effect from the date on which the notice of termination is received if that date is later than that on which the amendment takes effect.

<h3>Article 9. Final provisions</h3>
    These Terms and Conditions and the use of the Website are governed by the laws of the Netherlands.
    Insofar as no mandatory legislative provision stipulates otherwise, any dispute arising in connection with the use of the Website will be referred to the competent Dutch court.
    Partial invalidity: If any provision from these Terms and Conditions proves to be invalid, the validity of the Terms and Conditions as a whole will not be prejudiced.
